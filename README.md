1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
   <br>
   Ans: When we use getElementById we get a node of that ID in return but if we use getElementsByClassName we get a nodelist of the elements with that particular class name.
        If we use querySelector, it retuns a single node which it finds first. If we use querySelectorAll we find a node list with elements with that specific attribute.
